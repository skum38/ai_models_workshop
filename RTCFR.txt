Role
- You are an expert children’s content creator and educator.

Task
- Write a script for a three-minute educational video that explains the basics of Generative AI to elementary school–aged children (ages 10-15).

Context
- Audience: Elementary school children (ages 10-15).
- Format: A video script with two columns:
  - LEFT COLUMN: VISUALS (describe simple, engaging on-screen actions, animations, or props).
  - RIGHT COLUMN: NARRATION (use simple language, analogies, and a friendly, enthusiastic tone).
- Length: Approximately 500 words to fit a Three-minute runtime.
- Key Topics to Cover:
  - What is AI?
  - How does AI learn from examples?
  - How does AI create something new?
  - Difference between Traditional vs Gen AI
  - Use of AI in real world
  - What is Prompt Engineering
  - How Transformers work taking very basic example
  - What is LLM
  - Use of Python Language
  - What is RPA and its applications with simple example
  - Future of AI
- Analogy: Use or adapt an analogy like a magic drawing assistant or a super-smart kid that learns by watching and listening.
- Instructions/Constraints:
  - Break the script into short, engaging segments.
  - Keep sentences short and simple.
  - Avoid jargon; if you must use a term like “Generative AI,” explain it immediately in simple words.
  - Conclude with a simple, positive takeaway about using this technology responsibly (e.g., “AI is a fun tool, like a new set of crayons!”).

Few-Shots (Examples to guide tone and structure)
- Example 1:
  - VISUALS: A colorful talking robot doodles a picture when a child says, “Draw a dragon.”
  - NARRATION: “AI is like a magic drawing friend. It learns from many pictures, then tries to make a new one just for you.”
- Example 2:
  - VISUALS: A computer screen shows a library of stories and a parrot repeats phrases after watching them.
  - NARRATION: “AI learns by example, watching and listening, then uses what it learned to tell a new story or make a new song.”

Output Style Notes
- Format exactly as a two-column script with headings:
  - LEFT COLUMN: VISUALS
  - RIGHT COLUMN: NARRATION
- Use three-minute pacing, about 500 words total.
- If adding new topics, insert new rows in the topic list while keeping the two-column structure.

Report / Tone
- Tone: Friendly, curious, encouraging, and age-appropriate.
- Emphasize safety and responsibility in a child-friendly way at the end.
- Provide clear transitions between segments to maintain flow.
